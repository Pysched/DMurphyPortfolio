# Darren Murphy Portfolio
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 
For this project, I created a portfolio website for the purpose of promoting my skills, abilities and identity to prospective employers. The portfolio showcases a number (4-6) of projects that represent the variety of skills and abilities that I both offer and have developed. It also includes a snapshot of my biography, personality, education, coding skills and multimedia skillsets.  
## Demo
## UX
In the design of this site, my aim was to deliver a simple, minimal yet elegant website that presents information in an easy to view, understand and logical presentation. The development of the colour palette was designed to complement this approach. 
Colour Scheme to be developed and iterated on to understand how it all could work together. This will include paying attention to accessibility concerns such as colour contract and usability concerns of being aware/unaware of hover states and interaction capabilities.
For employers, I am providing a brief overview of my previous experiences, and my personality, this will serve as a brief “get to know me” to warm and inform potential employers to my friendly and amiable nature.
I will be providing links to both previous web and coding works as well as media related pieces I have developed and worked on. The aim being to sell myself with all the bells and whistles attached, however with out displaying everything in one place, potential employers will get a taste of what I am capable of. 
There are also links to my LinkedIn profile, my GitHub and a downloadable CV detailing my entire working and educational history.

The about me section contains 3 dropdown areas with content within each for the users to explore quick snippets about my education, Achievements and Hobbies. They also contain images from my own personal experiences.
The skills section features bar graphs to represent my skill levels in these areas/  These serve to illustrate my skill level both with coding, research and implementation.
The works section, features containers with media links to some of my works.
The contact section features a form that users can fill out to get in touch with me. This form is content sensitive and will require users to fill all fields and fill them correctly. An error indicator will highlight an issue for the users to rectify before submitting the information.
The CV Section features 2 button that will either download the pdf of my CV for users or bring them to a page where they can view it.
